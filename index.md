# Project Overview

This project showcases the development of a **machine learning regression model** designed to predict the sale prices of residential homes.  
The work combines advanced **feature engineering**, **model optimization**, and **data visualization** techniques to produce accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Background

> “Predicting real estate prices requires understanding both numbers and neighborhoods.”

The goal of this project was to create a high-performing model that could accurately estimate housing prices based on multiple input features such as square footage, year built, and neighborhood rating.  
The dataset used was the **Ames Housing Dataset**, which contains detailed records of nearly 3,000 residential homes.
